# About me

I am Ismaël Koné from Côte d'Ivoire, currently PhD student at Faculté des Sciences - Université Moulay Ismail in Meknès, Morocco. My research focuses on using Artificial Intelligence specifically Machine/Deep learning techniques for Medical Image Analysis. I mainly work on 3D cine-cardiac MR images for cardiac disease diagnosis like heart failure and histology images of women breast for early cancer detection.
